# data-encryption
Message encryption through bitwise manipulation\n
The program encrypts user data through bitwise XOR operation on the ASCII value of each character in a given message and conversion to binary, storing the binary
expression in a data structure (i.e. 2D char array) the size of a standard QR code (256 characters). The program also can compress the binary message to a hexadecimal
string of size 64, allowing for better use of space.
